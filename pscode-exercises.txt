// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

function sum(a,b){
	return a+b
}

a = int
b = int
Input number one(a) : ??
Input number two(b): ??

answer = sum(a,b)




// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

function check_even_odd(number){
	even_odd = number % 2

	if(even_odd == 1){
		print("this number is ODD")
	}else{
		print("this number is EVEN")
	} 
}

number_a = int

Input number one(number_a) : ??
check_even_odd(number_a)



// Exercise 3:

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
